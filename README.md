## Node.js Backend Development Practice Folder

### Introduction

This folder serves as a repository for my Node.js backend development practice files. As a Computer Engineering student named Jerome Yang, I have been honing my skills in building robust and scalable backend applications using Node.js.

### About Me

Hi! I am Jerome Yang at the time of this file creation is a Computer Engineering Student.

## Certification

I am currently pursuing a certification in Node.js, Express, and MongoDB development through a course on Udemy. The course I am undertaking is titled [Node.js, Express, MongoDB & More: The Complete Bootcamp 2023](https://www.udemy.com/course/nodejs-express-mongodb-bootcamp/). This comprehensive bootcamp provides hands-on training and practical exercises to master the essential concepts and tools required for developing efficient and modern backend systems.

By creating this practice folder, I aim to organize and store the Node.js files I have accumulated throughout my learning journey. These files represent my progress and growth in understanding key backend development principles, including routing, middleware, database integration, authentication, and more.

Feel free to explore the files in this folder to get insights into my coding style, problem-solving approach, and the evolution of my skills in Node.js backend development.
